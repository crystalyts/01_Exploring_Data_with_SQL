# 01_Exploring_Data_with_SQL
This is the first project from the WBS Coding School "Data Science" Bootcamp. It focuses on making data-driven business decisions using SQL and Tableau. 

My task is to analyze the sales data from Magist, an online shop based in Brazil, and provide a recommendation to Eniac, a European company specializing in Apple products, regarding their potential expansion into the Brazilian market and whether or not they should pursue a partnership with Magist.

To begin, I conducted a  analysis of revenue, orders, and deliveries by using SQL to join multiple tables. I then delved deeper into the data using Tableau. Based on my findings, I developed a 3-minute presentation that explains why I do not recommend pursuing the partnership.
