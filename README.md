# 01_Exploring_Data_with_SQL
This project focuses on making data-driven business decisions using SQL and Tableau.

I first utilizes the sales data from Magist, an online shop based in Brazil. Magist's revenue, orders and deliveries were analysed by joining different tables in SQL. I explored the data further in Tableau. Then I created a 3-minute presentation which discusses the potential partnership between Magist and Eniac, a European company specialised in Apple products, to expand their market in Brazil.
